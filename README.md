`autobib` automatically fetches BibTeX entries from online databases (currently Inspire and ADS) based on references that were added to the LaTeX document but not yet to the `.bib` file. The automatically fetched entries are appended to the first `.bib` file defined in your LaTeX source (first entry of `\bibliography{...}`). For this to work, the cite key has to be a key used by the online database.

In other words, you still need to look up a citation online and copy the cite key to your LaTeX file, but you don't have to also copy the whole BibTeX entry to your local `.bib` file (essentially adding it twice), since `autobib` does the latter for you.

`autobib` only appends new entries to your `.bib` file and otherwise leaves it as is. Using it is therefore safe.

## Installation and usage

`pip install autobib`

This installs a new script called `bibtex-autobib`, which is a drop-in replacement of the original `bibtex` command. The easiest way to make it work automatically with tooling like `latexmk` is to create a symlink

`ln -s /path/to/bibtex-autobib /some/path/bibtex`

where `/some/path/bibtex` comes before the original `bibtex` command in the PATH environment variable. Be careful that you do not override the original `bibtex` command.

After doing that, you can check whether the command `bibtex` is calling `autobib` by calling `bibtex --version` on the command-line. You should see something like this
```
autobib 0.6.0
BibTeX 0.99d (TeX Live 2020)
[...]
```
If this is not the case, then you may have to change the order of search paths in the `PATH` environment variable.

### ADS token

No extra steps are needed to download from Inspire, but to download from ADS you need to [follow these instructions](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api#access) to get an API token. Export this token in your shell as ADS_TOKEN, e.g. `export ADS_TOKEN=<insert token here>`.
